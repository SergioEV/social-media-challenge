# social-media-challenge
October 2, 2017 AzDev Challenge


## Challenge
Build a small program that utilizes data from one of the following APIs:
```
Twitter
Facebook
Instagram
Google Maps
Any other social media site
```
This can be a web application, an ios/android app, a command line application, graphs of data from R, or basically anything you can think of, if youâ€™re not sure, ask for help!

## Examples
Example 1: web app that displays twitter tweets by geographic location
Example 2: Tracking the frequency of different word usage on facebook, and displaying the statistics in the command line


## Pro tips

- Look for API wrappers rather than trying to interact directly with an API via HTTP
- Keep your keys private, if you expose them make sure you revoke them
- Try to work on different things in pairs that way you can learn together while still getting a lot done
